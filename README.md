## https://ezv-web.vercel.app

This is a project built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. The project includes a set of reusable components, pages, and API endpoints that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.

### Getting started
To get started, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ditcu-code/ezv-web.git
cd my-nextjs-project
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000. You can now start editing the code and see your changes live in the browser.
